## Project Proposal

The integration of wearable health technology with smart home systems presents new opportunities for personalized living environments that adapt to users' physiological and psychological states.

In this study, we propose an intelligent home automation framework that continuously monitors biometric data from Apple Watch, analyzes user wellness states through deep learning models, and automatically optimizes home appliances using LLM-based reasoning.

The system collects real-time health metrics including heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), sleep patterns, and activity levels, combined with contextual data such as GPS location and weather conditions.

An LSTM-based neural network with attention mechanisms predicts stress levels, fatigue, and sleep readiness, which are then processed through OpenAI's GPT API to generate natural language commands for controlling temperature, lighting, humidity, and other smart home devices.

Through Smart Health Home, we demonstrate a practical approach to creating adaptive living environments that proactively respond to users' health conditions, enhancing comfort, wellness, and quality of life.
