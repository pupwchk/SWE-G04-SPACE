\begin{abstract}
Smart home technology has significantly enhanced household convenience through automation; however, it still faces limitations in user personalization and proactive responsiveness. This project proposes an Intelligent Smart Home Agent System that integrates three key functions: (1) user state analysis leveraging biometric and weather data, (2) persona-based prompting grounded in initial user preferences, and (3) an alert-and-call mechanism for anomaly detection. The system establishes an AI persona whose personality and response style are shaped by the user's basic information and lifestyle patterns. Through ongoing interaction and feedback, the system incrementally refines its behavior, adapting to the user's evolving routines and preferences. Furthermore, the system enables bi-directional voice communication between the user and the home AI. Ultimately, the proposed system—HARU—aims to establish a more intelligent and empathetic home environment by implementing a context-aware, self-evolving agent that allows seamless interaction from any location, autonomously manages daily conditions, and continuously learns to align with the user's physical and emotional state.
